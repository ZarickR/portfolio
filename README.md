# ZarickR - What I can do for the gaming community.

So this is what I would call a porforlio website, that showcases my work on things that have inspired me to make cool projects for the gaming community.

This will be a site that will hopefully continue to grow as I add projects to it, and I will do my best to keep it updated.

Be aware that even though I'm happy to colaborate with the commumity, since this is my portfolio website, your pull request will most likely be rejected. This is just so that I can continue to hone my skills, and to have better control of the site itself. If you do decide to make a pull request, please state why and how would the site benefit from it.

Thanks for reading.
